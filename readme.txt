Quickly generate custom front-end login, register, password reset and account profile forms for a WordPress site.

== Description ==

Custom WP Login replaces the WordPress login flow with custom pages. It allows you to have a complete user registration and login experience on the public-facing pages of your WordPress site. This is useful for sites who want to use WordPress' built-in users functionality, but only want to keep users on the front-end of the site and not in the WordPress dashboard.

**Features**

* Set pages for Login form, Registration form, Reset Password form, Select New Password for and Account Profile form.
* Customize the Login Page, with a logo, background, image, form colors and more!
* Add reCaptcha to the Login form.
* Customize the welcome email users receive after they register.


Shortcodes:
`[custom-login-form]`
`[custom-register-form]`
`[custom-password-lost-form]`
`[custom-password-reset-form]`
`[account-info]`
